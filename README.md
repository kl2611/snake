###Instructions
Use arrow keys to move and collect the apples! Every 5 points will increase the level and speed of the snake. 

###About
Written using JavaScript and HTML5 with the Phaser framework. Javascript functions determine in-game logic such as collisions between the snake/self, snake/apple, and snake/wall. Score is updated whenever the snake collides with the apple. Restarting the game will redraw a new board and reset score.
